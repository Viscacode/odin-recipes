    <h2>Juicy, Crispy, and Flavorful</h2>
    <ul>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <li>1 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup sake</li>
        <li>½ cup mirin (Japanese sweet wine)</li>
        <li>¼ cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>3 green onions, chopped, white and dark green parts separated</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons finely grated ginger</li>
        <li>10 skinless, boneless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <li>Whisk soy sauce, sake, mirin, brown sugar, white parts of green onions, and ginger together in a saucepan; bring to a simmer and cook until sugar dissolves and marinade flavors combine, about 5 minutes. Pour marinade into a bowl and cool to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Pour 1/2 the marinade into a resealable plastic bag. Add chicken thighs, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator, 30 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and grease with vegetable oil.</li>
        <li>Arrange chicken thighs on prepared baking sheet. Discard excess marinade.</li>
        <li>Broil chicken in the preheated oven for 5 minutes. Flip thighs and broil for 5 minutes more. Flip thighs again and brush each thigh with reserved marinade. Continue to broil, brushing with reserved marinade every 1 to 2 minutes, until cooked through, about 12 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Garnish with dark green parts of green onions.</li>
